            <h2>Repetition</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.obermayer.com"> Obermayer</a>
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/repetition.jpg" alt="mobile website screenshot">
            </figure>
            <p>Repetition means the reusing of the same or similar elements throughout a design. Doing so brings a
                clear sense of unity, consistency, and cohesiveness to a website </p>
            <p>
                In this example from the Obermayer website you can see instances of repetition
                in the use of color (gray and yellow), the business logo is repeated in the header image and the same font is repeated throughout
                the site just to name a few.

            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.lds.org"> Church Of Jesus Christ </a>
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/hicks-law.jpg" alt="mobile website screenshot">
            </figure>
            <p>Hick’s Law states that the more stimuli (or choices) users face, the longer it
                will take them to make a decision. For designers of all types, this presents a challenge, making it
                imperative to offer the most useful set of options to avoid frustrating the user. The objective of
                Hick's Law is to try and simplify the decision-making process, not eliminate that process entirely.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this example from The Church of Jesus Christ website, you can see that the minimal navigation options
                to simplify the decision-making process for the user.

            <h2>Fitt's Law</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://aod.thealisonshow.com/"> Awesome on Demand </a>
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/fitts-law.jpg" alt="mobile website screenshot">
            </figure>
            <p>Fitt's Law dictates that fast movements and small targets result in greater error rates, due to the
                speed-accuracy
                trade-off. This means that the smaller your target area is, the longer it takes the user to perform that
                action based on the distance/size ratio. A classic example of this would be the clickable buttons on a
                responsive website. According to Fitts Law, it’s good practice to ensure that the buttons are a little
                bit bigger as the user will be predominantly using their fingers to click the buttons.</p>
            <p>
                In this example from the website Awesome on Demand, you can see the large "Join Awesome on Demand"
                button is large and easy to find on the mobile version.
